# FPGA Debounce Push Button - Basys 3

**Description:**

This project implements a debounce logic for a push button on the Basys 3 FPGA board using SystemVerilog and Xilinx Vivado. The debounce logic helps filter out noise and ensure stable and reliable readings from the push button.

**Features:**
- Debounce logic for a push button to eliminate noise and provide stable readings.
- Implemented on the Basys 3 FPGA board.
- Developed using SystemVerilog and Xilinx Vivado.


**Project Structure:**
- `src/`: Contains the SystemVerilog source code.
- `constraints/`: Includes the constraints file for the Basys 3 board.
- `vivado_project/`: Vivado project files.


Enjoy implementing debounce logic and slow clock conversion on the Basys 3 FPGA board!
